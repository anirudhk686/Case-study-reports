## Antarctic weather data analysis using ARIMA model 
`python` `Jupyter-notebook` `statsmodel` `matplotlib`<br>
* This project was also part of my internship at [National Centre for Antarctic and Ocean Research](http://www.ncaor.gov.in/) , India.
* After priliminary analysis, modeled temperature data with the Seasonal ARIMA model. Forecast was also done based on the obtained model.
* Wind speed analysis was done. Here main objective was to find out the monthly blizzard distribution.
* Detailed note of methodology followed is described in this [**_Project report_**](https://github.com/anirudhk686/weather_data_analysis/blob/master/Final_report.pdf).<br>

## Boston house pricing model: A linear regression analysis <br>
* Use the hedonic multiple regression model to examine the influence of various
neighborhood attributes on housing prices in Boston in an attempt to discover the most
suitable explanatory variables.
* Fit a linear regression model that best explains the variation in the response variable

## A study of determinants influencing perception of consumers towards advertisements
* In this project, we have studied about consumer perception across different advertisements.We have also tried find out the different factors affecting the preference of the product for the consumer when they see an advertisement. We have taken our institutes students, some outsiders/mess workers, and medical practitioners as the sample population for our study.
* Given below are the two objectives of our study:
A. To study how same advertisement may have varying level of influence,depending upon the demographic distribution of the population.
B. To study how brand value factor can be of importance in advertising, and how its importance varies across different demographic distributions.
