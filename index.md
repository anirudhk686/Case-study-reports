## Antarctic weather data analysis using ARIMA model <br>(_June 2017_)
`python` `Jupyter-notebook` `statsmodel` `matplotlib`<br>
* This project was also part of my internship at [National Centre for Antarctic and Ocean Research](http://www.ncaor.gov.in/) , India.
* After priliminary analysis, modeled temperature data with the Seasonal ARIMA model. Forecast was also done based on the obtained model.
* Wind speed analysis was done. Here main objective was to find out the monthly blizzard distribution.
* Detailed note of methodology followed is described in this [**_Project report_**](https://github.com/anirudhk686/weather_data_analysis/blob/master/Final_report.pdf).<br>
